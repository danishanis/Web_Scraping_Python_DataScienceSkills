# Web_Scraping_Python_DataScienceSkills
*Web Scraping tool in Python to locate and extract Data Science job information from indeed.ca and visualize the most sought after job skills*

## Background

Web scraping or web data extraction is an automatic software technique for extracting information from web-sites. As per [www.infoworld.com](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html), nearly 44ZB of data will be produced by the end of 2020, 90% of which will be unstructured in nature. Preparation of data for analysis takes up most of a Data Scientist's time (Source: Deloitte University Press) and this is particularly true for applications requiring extraction of data from websites, such as job search tools. As not all job search web-sites provide APIs, one of the most popular areas for web scrapping is online job search.

## Aim

Our aim was to find a website like [https://www.indeed.ca](https://www.indeed.ca) which allows web scraping and parse HTML pages with \data scientist" job titles to extract position title, employer, location, salary, etc. An important library used for this was the *BeautifulSoup* in Python for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
